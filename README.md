# Smart Fresh (WIP)
This project is an intelligent food storage monitoring companion designed to address this issue by providing users with objective, real-time data on the condition of their stored food. The Smart Fresh device continuously monitors key environmental parameters within food containers that are indicative of spoilage, specifically ammonia gas concentration, temperature, and humidity, recording data at 30-minute intervals. An integrated microcontroller processes the collected sensor data, utilizing an exponential relationship model to calculate current freshness levels and predict the remaining shelf life of the stored items.
